## üß™ Confirming  

### Confirm Option: Implement Pawn Promotion  

In chess, when a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank (8th for white, 1st for black), it must be promoted to **Queen**, **Rook**, **Knight**, or **Bishop**.  

- **Task**: Detect pawn promotion and allow the player to select the desired piece.  
- **Validation**: Ensure the promoted piece behaves correctly according to chess rules.
